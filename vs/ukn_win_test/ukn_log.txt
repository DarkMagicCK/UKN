[0.001] *Warning* ID3D11DeviceContext::Draw: The Pixel Shader unit expects a Sampler to be set at Slot 0, but none is bound. This is perfectly valid, as a NULL Sampler maps to default Sampler state. However, the developer may not want to rely on the defaults. 
[0.001] *Warning* ID3D11Device::CreateInputLayout: The provided input signature expects to read an element with SemanticName/Index: 'COLOR'/0 and component(s) of the type 'float32'.  However, the matching entry in the Input Layout declaration, element[1], specifies mismatched format: 'R8G8B8A8_UINT'.  This is not an error, since behavior is well defined: The element format determines what data conversion algorithm gets applied before it shows up in a shader register. Independently, the shader input signature defines how the shader will interpret the data that has been placed in its input registers, with no change in the bits stored.  It is valid for the application to reinterpret data as a different type once it is in the vertex shader, so this warning is issued just in case reinterpretation was not intended by the author.
